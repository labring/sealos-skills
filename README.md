# Sealos Skills

Deploy projects to [Sealos Cloud](https://gzg.sealos.run) from your AI agent.

Sealos Skills is both a `skills.sh` skill pack and a Codex plugin package centered on `/sealos-deploy`. It helps an agent inspect a project, prepare missing deployment artifacts, and ship it to Sealos Cloud.

## Quick Start

Install Sealos Skills:

```bash
npx skills add labring/sealos-skills
```

Then run:

```text
/sealos-deploy
```

Examples:

```text
/sealos-deploy
/sealos-deploy /path/to/project
/sealos-deploy https://github.com/labring-sigs/kite
```

## How Setup Works

You only need a `skills.sh` compatible AI agent and a project to deploy.

During the deploy flow, Sealos Skills will:

- check whether tools such as Docker and `kubectl` are available
- guide the user through Sealos login when needed
- use or help prepare a container registry path such as Docker Hub or GHCR

For an actual deployment, you will still need a Sealos Cloud account and access to a container registry, but these do not need to be fully set up before the skill starts.

## What `/sealos-deploy` Handles

On a typical deploy, the agent will:

1. Assess the project structure and runtime needs.
2. Reuse an existing image or build one when needed.
3. Generate a Sealos template.
4. Deploy and verify rollout.

Later runs can switch to an in-place update flow when an existing deployment is detected.

## Repository

[`skills/`](./skills) is the single source of truth for `/sealos-deploy` and the supporting skills it uses during the deploy flow. The same root-level skills directory serves both `skills.sh` installs and the Codex plugin declared by [`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`](./.codex-plugin/plugin.json).
